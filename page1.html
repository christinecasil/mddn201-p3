			<h1>About Three Dimes</h1>
			
			<p>This whole project idea was inspired by the ‘Solitary Confinement’ project. For this project it uses software and displays PC that is infected by this virus. From the idea of using softare and technology this display is something bad so when thinking about my inital idea I wanted to incorporate a software that would help people and was good and helpful to users. I came up with Three Dimes which the idea was inspired by the ‘Solitary Confinement’ project. For further information about this project click <a heref="https://julianoliver.com/output/solitary-confinement" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

			<p>Three Dimes focuses solely for online shoppers. This function installed in mobile phones allows people to project objects from online in three dimension. There are two size options that they can project the object or item using their mobile phone which is a small size so the user can visually see what the item looks like when holding their phones in their hands. The other projection option is a real-life scale, so by placing their phone on the ground whatever object or item that is projected will be shown in three dimension to what is looks like physically, so a real-life size of the object.</p>

			<p>How this set up works is that users who online shop can pick and choose item or objects they consider buying but are unsure about the size of an item, the look or quality.</p>

			<p>There is a button function that collects and computes all the information about that product and will project it to the users desired size they want to project it at. Three Dimes helps users who are online shopping make a distinct decision on items they want to buy and by using this function, it maximises the time, effort and money of having to refund or return the item if they didn’t like it or it was the wrong size or was bad quality.</p>

			<p>The intended audience is for this function are aimed at teens and those who are older. This audience is more likely too online shop and would find Three Dimes a useful tool to better their online shopping and experience.</p>
